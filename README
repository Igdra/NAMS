## NAMS
__Not Another MUD Server__

NAMS is a C++ MUD server with the primary goals of a safe, modular design and a
server core that is substantially decouppled from game logic. NAMS has been designed
as a generic, robust framework on which to build a rich and immersive game world.

There is a special file 'src/.dirbuild' that will re-create the required directory
structure and then be removed upon first make. This is to work around the limitations
of Git not tracking empty directories.

__Support for this code is provided both via GitHub and the project website.__
