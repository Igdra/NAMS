NAMS - Not Another MUD Server

NAMS is a C++ MUD server with the primary goals of a safe, modular design and a
server core that is substantially decouppled from game logic. NAMS has been designed
as a generic, robust framework on which to build a rich and immersive game world.

There is a special file 'src/.dirbuild' that will re-create the required directory
structure and then be removed upon first make. This is to work around the limitations
of Git not tracking empty directories.

Support for this code is provided both via GitHub and the project website.
