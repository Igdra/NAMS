NAMS - Not Another MUD Server
    High Level Overview - Directory

This document provides a high level overview of directory layout and purpose
within the NAMS server.

root folder/
        The top level folder contains all components of NAMS within its
        subfolders. The only file maintained as the root level is the
        README.

    command/
        Within the command folder are a..z subfolders. Within each subfolder
        are command files. Commands each exist as a single file given a unique
        name within the constraints of the host operating system.

    doc/
        All NAMS documentation is stored within this folder aside from the README.
        A copy of the GPLv3 license is also provided here.

    log/
        All log files generated by NAMS are stored within the log folder. While
        not currently implemented, NAMS intends to support multiple event driven
        logs and automatic log rotation.

    src/
        Within the src folder are h and o subfolders. Header files are kept
        within the h subfolder, while compiled object files and an automatically
        generated dependencies file are stored within the o subfolder. All other
        source code is kept directly within the src folder. The Makefile is also
        contained here.
