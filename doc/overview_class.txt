NAMS - Not Another MUD Server
    High Level Overview - Class

This document provides a high level overview of class inheritance and purpose
within the NAMS server.

Namespace
    Utils       Currently all non-member functions are kept within this namespace.

Class
    Command
        Inherits: None
        Children: None

        A single command within the server. Command structure is loaded
        from disk at boot time. Once fully implemented, command logic is
        intended to run either natively compiled into the server or
        via a yet-to-be determined scripting language (TCL, Ruby, etc).

    Server
        Inherits: None
        Children: None

        The server core. Currently, NAMS is designed utilizing a single
        Server instance. However, it would be possible for this to be
        forked or threaded into multiple instances such as alternative
        ports or game worlds.

    Socket
        Inherits: None
        Children: SocketClient, SocketServer

        An individual socket connection within a Server. Sockets are
        currently implemented as IPv4 TCP connections only. In the
        future, sockets will also support IPv6 connectivity.

    SocketClient
        Inherits: Socket
        Children: None

        An individual socket connection to a remote client. In addition
        to the base functions of a socket, a client socket implements
        threaded hostname resolution and all input / output / queue
        processing. A client socket references back to a single Server
        object.

    SocketServer
        Inherits: Socket
        Children: None

        An individual listening socket on a Server. Beyond basic
        socket functions, Server sockets only implement methods
        to bind to an address and listen for incomming connections.
